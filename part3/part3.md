#### "In Part Three, we’ll configure IP addresses, Layer-3 EtherChannel, and Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP). HSRP, a Cisco proprietary redundancy protocol, ensures automatic router failover to maintain high availability and prevent network outages. It assigns a virtual IP address to the router with the highest priority, making it the active router. If the active router goes offline, the next highest-priority router takes over. With a feature called preemption, we can configure the highest-priority router to automatically regain its active role once it’s back online. In this section, we’ll enable preemption to optimize our HSRP setup."
